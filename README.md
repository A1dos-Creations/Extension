# School-Portal-Opener
School Portal Opener - v1.0.0
# Welcome To The home for the best School Tools!
<p style="font-size:7;">Version 1.2.1b</p>

<P>This is the official github for School Tool Launcher. Here you will find the source code for the extension. 
As new updates roll out, this github will be updated. </P>  

# Information
> Whats STL?
STL is an abreviation of 'School Tool Launcher'. This extension simplifies the school day by allowing students to access necesary resources with the click of a button.
> What are it's benefits?
> 
STL allows students to access required and necesary school resuources quickly to ensure a smooth learning experience with as little destractions as possible.  

# What's next?
Next, I am hoping to add a destraction blocker that will be active during school hours. I am also hoping to add an 'auto sign-in' option for select school portals. Users would have the ability to opt-out and delete their information with the click of a button.
